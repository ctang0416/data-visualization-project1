I would like to compare the population in 1900 and 2000 in the chart, I choose to use a grouped bar chart to show the data.

For the color shades of the bar, I choose to use just a darker grey and a lighter grey instead of using different colors because I think this way would make the visualization cleaner. For the y-axis scale, I make the unit be in 100000 people so that the scale won\u2019t be a long number which might be hard to read."}),a("p",{children:"One of the insights I got from the chart is that there is a huge population growth between 1900 and 2000. I think one of the reasons might be a baby boom. There was a baby boom from 1946  to 1964. As we can see in the cart, the ages that have the most significant difference between 1900 and 200 are age 35 and 40, which those people\u2019s age match the year of the baby boom. Another reason that might increase the population might be immigration. There are some immigration waves between 1900 and 2000. With immigration, it can increase the population at any age. Additionally, in the chart, we can also see that there are more people at the age of 90 in 2000 than in 1900. With all the technology and medication improvement, I think people would be able to live a longer life. There are also a lot more babies born in 2000 compared to 1900. Since there are more people in the age of 20s and 30s, it\u2019s reasonable that there are more babies."}),A("p",{children:[" Link to Github page: ",a("a",{href:"https://github.com/ctang0416/data-visualization-project1.git",children:"https://github.com/ctang0416/data-visualization-project1.git"})]})]})}k.render(a(z.StrictMode,{children:a(L,{})}),document.getElementById("root"));
